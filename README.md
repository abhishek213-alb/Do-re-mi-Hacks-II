# Musicallywin.us

Official Submission to do-re-mi-hacks-II organized by MLH.


## Inspiration 💡
We did a lot of research on the use of aptitude tests to help children develop their analytical and logical abilities. Based on our research, We feel that if we could test out the listening and analytical capabilities of children through music; it would not only interest their participation in such activities but they could have fun doing it.

## What it does 🧭

Musicallywin.us consists of 2 mini games on the web app which test one's listening, analytical and remembering capabilities. With the help of our test results one can accurately monitor their child's progress in their thinking capabilities. With Twilio integration, we send a sms to our user based on their performance for them to be able to track their progress. 

## How we built it 🔧


## Technology Stack 🔨
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS 
4. Node.js
5. Twilio
6. Git and GitHub
7. Canva
8. Davinci Resolve 


## Challenges we ran into 🏃‍♂️
 - Integrating Twilio was a real headache, we faced authentication errors and integration errors but somehow made it work.
 - Designing and integrating all the games into a single web-app was a race against time. 
 - Overall integration was extremely difficult and time-consuming. We had initially planned 5 different games for our complete project, but were able to complete 2 in a working manner.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏅
 - Easy to understand, well-documented code.
 - Successfully completed the project with the necessary requisites. 
 - Building something creative and imaginitive in the field of music. 


## What's next for Musicallywin.us ⏭
 - To add in more games to stimulate critical thinking capabilities.
 - Publish a total score so as to monitor one's progress.
